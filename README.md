This repository demonstrates a common but often overlooked error in React Native development: linking issues with third-party libraries that use native modules. The example uses `react-native-fs`, but the principle applies to many other such libraries.  The `RNFSBug.js` file shows the error caused by improper linking, while `RNFSBugSolution.js` provides the corrected code and steps to resolve the issue.
