This error occurs when using a third-party library that is not properly linked to your React Native project. It might manifest as a runtime error or a build error.  For example, you might see an error like `undefined is not an object (evaluating 'RNFS.readDir')` if you are using the `react-native-fs` library without the correct linking steps. This is common with libraries using native modules.
