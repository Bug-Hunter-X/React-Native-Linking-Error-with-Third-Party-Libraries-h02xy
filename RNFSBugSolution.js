To fix this, ensure you've correctly linked the library. This typically involves running a linking command (often provided in the library's documentation). For `react-native-fs`, you'd typically run something similar to `react-native link react-native-fs`.  If using newer React Native versions, manual linking might be needed.  Check the library's documentation for detailed instructions.  Always check that the library's native dependencies are correctly installed and linked on both iOS and Android.  If using Expo managed workflow, ensure the library is compatible with Expo or use the bare workflow.

```javascript
// RNFSBugSolution.js
import RNFS from 'react-native-fs'; // Make sure this library is properly linked

const readDir = async () => {
  try {
    const result = await RNFS.readDir('/');
    console.log('Files and directories:', result);
  } catch (err) {
    console.error('Error reading directory:', err);
  }
};

readDir();
```
